Javacript:

(1) Makes the page interactive
(2) is very fast - JS runs on the client machine
(3) there is no compilations and no dependency on the servers in the BE
(4) Interpreter

Java NOT EQUAL TO Javacript, they are no way related

        Java / c#           |       Javascript
                            |
(1)     Compiler            |       Interpreter 
(2)     a BE language       |       a FE language
(3)     Server involved     |       No Server involved



(1) A programmer writes code in a programming language (high level)
(2) The programmer code is converted to an intermediate code
    a.
    b.
(3) This intermediate code then gets converted to machine code (low level) (0's and 1's)

George Boole  -  0 and 1

Compiler: reads the entire code and converts it as a whole chunk to the machine code at once.
            * if your code has problems, gets detected early and code will not compile
            * it is a slow process

Interpreter: reads one line of code at a time and converts it into machine code.
            * Even if your code has issues, you can still see the o/p till Interpreter reaches to bad code
            * it is a fast process


/********************* Variables in JS ************************/

Vraiable: name given to memory location temporarily

Variables can be created using the following keywords
(1) var
(2) let
(3) const

Scope of Variables : visibility of a Variable in a program

line 1
line 2 // create a variable
..
..

line 10

line 80 // can I use the variable in line 80 ? will the variable be accessible / visible here
...


..

line 120

(1) Global Scope: a vriable is visible throughout the program
(2) local scope: means a variable has limited visibility. Local to some block of code


/********************* Datatypes in JS ************************/

Datatype: type of data a variable can hold

(1) Primitive Datatype
    - number (digits, integer, float, decimal)
    - string (char, varchar, string)
    - boolean (true:1, false:0)
(2) Reference Datatype - 
    - array: contigous locations of memory holding the data
    - function (classes)
    - object
(3) other Data types
    - undefined: variable whose value is not defined
    - null: empty object


/********************* Operators in JS ************************/

(1) Arithmetic Operators
    a. + : adds numbers
    b. - : subtracts numbers
    c. * : multiplies numbers
    d. / : divides two numbers
    e. % : it gives the remainder of a division operation
    g. increment
        i. post increment
        ii. pre increment
    h. decrement
        i. post decrement
        ii. pre decrement
(2) Assigment Operators
    a. =  used to assign a value
    b. concise way of representation
(3) Comparison Operators
    a. == it compares the data value on both sides and NOT the data types
    b. === it compares the data value on both sides as well as the data types
    c. check rest in PPT
(4) Logical Operators
    a. && it checks the condition on both sides, if both are true, Then it returns true
    b. || it checks the condition on both sides, if either one of them is true, Then it returns true
    c. !  it gives you a negation / inversion of the value
